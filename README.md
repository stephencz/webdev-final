# webdev-final
This is my final project for my Introduction to Web Development class. 
The website is created is called **Body Weight Fact Sheets** and can generate
"fact sheets" from a person's sex, age, height, and weight.

The website is suppose to be both functional and educational. It provides useful
body weight related statistics such as BMI, BMR, TDEE, as well as projections
for when a person can expect to reach a certain goal weight at different calorie 
restrictions.
